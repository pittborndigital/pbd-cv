I took some time out from contracting to devote work to a new business idea, and to develop skills complimentary to software development.

I went through a process of interviewing potential users, establishing a value proposition and building a proof-of-concept prototype in order to gather feedback.

I used a variety of technologies to build the proof of concept, with time-to-market being the primary consideration:
- Firebase: Document database, with asynchronous DB triggers, email capability and simple analytics.
- Heroku to host a thin NodeJS graphql server.
- Gatsby and React for quickly building out a web interface for the public, in addition to a CMS for maintaining content.
