Working in a small and effective team to deliver new features and products to market, whilst strategically rearchitecting the client-side landscape. Responsible for the development and maintenance of two mobile apps and a GraphQL server. 

My role primarily involves working closely with company founders to take ideas from sketches to well-considered MVP feature development, solving UX challenges, addressing architecture considerations and ensuring a strong level of test coverage despite a lean approach.

Some of my key achievments at SportStack include:
- Taking a new product from prototype designs to a successful launch in both the Apple and Google stores in just over 3 months.
- Introducing and integrating TypeScript across both the GraphQL server and the mobile apps, using shared auto-generated type schemas (backend via Swagger typegen, and graphql via graphql-codegen) to minimise easily avoidable bugs and unnecessary boilerplate.
- Setting up continuous deployment pipelines for both GraphQL and the two mobile apps, initially using an old iMac in the office and latterly using CircleCI.
